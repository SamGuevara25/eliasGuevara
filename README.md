**Animations on Scroll:**
JavaScript observes when each section enters the viewport and adds animation classes for fade-in effects.

**Contact Form:**

Built with custom validation and integrated with EmailJS.

Sends the visitor’s message directly to my email inbox using a pre-configured template.

Displays custom success/error notifications.

**Responsive Behavior:**
The layout automatically adapts to any screen size using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.
